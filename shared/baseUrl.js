export const baseUrl = 'http://d9b2816552bb.ngrok.io/'; // this address is generated by ngrok in the Terminal without the trailing slash at the end - but gotta add that slash to the baseUrl here in order for the app to be able to fetch resources! Because baseUrl will be combined with other parts of addresses which don't have a slash in front! So gotta add the slash here!

// Note: my json-server is actually running at http://localhost:3005/, but ngrok provides a way for the phone to access it via http://d9b2816552bb.ngrok.io/. (addresses like http://localhost:3001/ work for React, but for React Native they don't - the phone can't access localhost. The issue and solution are decribed at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57304410/i-cant-access-to-data-in-json-server-from-react-native-with-use-of-fetchs-meth)

// Note 2: gotta strictly follow the ngrok instructions! Gotta unzip it using a terminal command on Mac, like they say, not with double click! Otherwise won't work! 
// ngrok.exe shouldn't be removed after installation - it provides the ngrok CLI
