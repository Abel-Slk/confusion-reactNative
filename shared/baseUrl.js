export const baseUrl = 'http://0a15ccf6d48b.ngrok.io/'; // NOTE: my json-server is actually running at http://localhost:3005/, but ngrok provides a way for the phone to access it via http://0a15ccf6d48b.ngrok.io/. addresses like http://localhost:3001/ worked for React, but for React Native they don't! The phone can't access localhost! The issue and solution are decribed at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57304410/i-cant-access-to-data-in-json-server-from-react-native-with-use-of-fetchs-meth. Note: gotta strictly follow the ngrok tutorial! Gotta unzip it using a terminal command on Mac, like they say! Otherwise won't work! and gotta type the next commands prefixed with "./" - like ./ngrok!
